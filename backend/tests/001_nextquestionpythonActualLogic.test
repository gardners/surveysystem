description Python implementation of nextquestion can be used

# note that this test requires the actual sleep question logic (Python) to be available.
#
# Create a dummy survey
# XXX - In any test where we use python, we need to make sure we don't reuse any survey name
# that appears in any othe test, else our python functions will be hanging around and will get used.
